The expected output of 90 days does not align with the user's specified timeframe of one year.\n\n**Recommended Action:** Update the golden test\n\n**Suggested Fix:** Change the golden test arguments to reflect a 365-day range to accurately match the user's request for one year of stock performance.",

      "comment": "Agreed with Claude: **Verdict:** Need more context\n\n**Reasoning:** The user’s request for \"all historical prices\" is ambiguous without additional context. It is unclear whether the user desires a comprehensive historical dataset (which could imply a longer range like 365 days or more) or a more recent history (like 90 days). The expected output assumes a specific timeframe without explicit user instruction.\n\n**Recommended Action:** Needs clarification\n\n**Suggested Fix:** Clarify the user's intent regarding the timeframe for \"all historical prices\" to determine whether they mean a shorter or longer historical range. Adjust the expected output accordingly once the user's intent is clear.",

The golden test correctly identifies this category, while the AI's output lacks specificity by not providing any category, potentially leading to a less relevant or overly broad response.\n\n**Recommended Action:** Update the AI's output to match the golden test\n\n**Suggested Fix:** Ensure that the AI includes the \"Profitability & Returns\" category in its arguments when the user inquires about profitability-related metrics.",

      "comment": "Agreed with Claude: **Verdict:** AI is correct\n\n**Reasoning:** The user asked about the \"cash position,\" which is a specific financial metric. However, understanding a company's cash position often involves related metrics like the \"current ratio\" and \"cash ratio,\" as they provide context on liquidity and cash availability. The AI's inclusion of these additional metrics offers a more comprehensive view, aligning with what a user might need to fully understand the cash position.\n\n**Recommended Action:** Update the golden test\n\n**Suggested Fix:** Modify the golden test to include \"current ratio\" and \"cash ratio\" in addition to \"cash position\" to provide a more complete financial picture.",
