**Interpreting Annotation Meaning**

I'm focusing on the user's question about the meaning of "@node (265-270)" linked to the "terminal_selection" they've provided. It seems to reference a section in the file "docs/scroll_not_working.md," particularly about Git folders. The term "node" likely points to an annotation concerning lines 265 to 270. I wonder if it's from the Cursor tool's markers, or possibly from browser developer tools. Checking the content of the file around those lines might clarify if "@node (265-270)" specifically appears, providing more insight for the user.
**Using Read File Tool**

I need to read the file "docs/scroll_not_working.md" to answer the user's question about "@node (265-270)." Before I do that, I'll provide a status update, then use the read_file function. I might end up searching the whole file for that text. The user's reference includes "terminal_selection" with content from lines 265 to 270, indicating a node range. Their specific wording suggests they might be looking for clarification about that annotation in their chat, possibly from Copilot or a similar tool.
**Reading File Content**

I'm ready to read the file to look at the headings near the relevant content. I’ll start by using the read_file function, so I can get a better understanding of what's going on around those lines. Before that, I need to provide a status update since it's important to keep track of what I'm doing. This should help me answer the user's question about the content effectively. Let's proceed with the file reading!</details></think>

I'll open the `docs/scroll_not_working.md` around those lines to see the exact context for “@node (265–270)” so I can explain it precisely.
