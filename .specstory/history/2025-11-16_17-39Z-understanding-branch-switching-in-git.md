# Understanding branch switching in git (2025-11-16 17:39Z)

When you switch branches, git changes the FILES INSIDE that one

**Explaining Git Branch Switching**

The user is asking about switching branches in Git and how it affects files. First off, branches are like different snapshots of a project's history. When switching, Git updates the files in the working directory to reflect the state of that branch. Untracked files stay the same, but staged changes may disappear. Only tracked files change, and files outside the repo aren’t affected. New, modified, or deleted files across branches need to be managed with commits or stashing to prevent losing changes. A brief example could help clarify this.
**Summarizing Git Branch Switching**

When explaining Git branch switching, I need to keep it clear and supportive for beginners. Here are four key points:

- Branches are snapshots of your project; switching changes files in the working directory to match the current branch.
- Example: On branch A, `config.json` is v1; on branch B, it's v2.
- Untracked files remain unchanged, while tracked files update. Files in .gitignore are unaffected.
- Unsaved changes can block switching, so use `git stash push -m` to save, then `git switch -` to switch back.

This should provide a concise and clear overview!
**Finalizing Git Branch Switching Explanation**

Alright, I’m putting together a clear explanation for switching branches in Git. Here’s how I’ll structure it:

- A branch is a specific snapshot of your project’s history.
- Switching updates your working directory to match the branch tip, which includes any file creation, deletion, or renaming—only tracked files change.
- Untracked files and anything outside the repository stay the same.
- If you have local changes, Git might refuse the switch; you can commit, stash, or force the switch (like using `git stash` or `git switch --force`). 

This should provide a solid overview!</details></think>

### Plain-English answer
- **A branch is a different version of your whole project.** Each branch points to a different snapshot of the code.
- **When you switch branches, Git rewrites the files in your project folder to match that branch’s snapshot.** That can mean some files change content, new files appear, and others disappear—whatever that branch has.
- **This only affects files tracked by Git inside that repository folder.** Untracked/ignored files usually stay as-is; anything outside the repo is untouched.
- **If you have local changes, Git may block the switch** to avoid losing work. Commit or stash first, or use a force-y option if you really know what you’re doing.

### Quick mental model
Think of your repo folder as a “window” showing one branch’s state at a time. Switching branches tells Git, “Replace what I’m seeing with the other version.”

### Common commands
```bash
# Switch to another branch
git switch feature/login

# If Git stops you because you have changes
git add -A && git commit -m "WIP"   # save changes
# or
git stash push -m "WIP"             # temporarily shelve them
git switch feature/login
git stash pop                        # bring them back if needed
```

- **What changes:** tracked files (content, adds, deletes, renames) to match the target branch.
- **What doesn’t:** untracked/ignored files and anything outside the repo.
