## What is a Filetree?

The filetree (file explorer) shows your project’s folders and files, like a folder view on your computer.

## Key Concepts

1. **Folders (Directories)**
   - Folders contain files and other folders.
   - In the filetree, folders usually have an arrow (`>`) or folder icon.
   - Click to expand/collapse and see what’s inside.

2. **Files**
   - Individual files (code, config, docs, etc.).
   - No arrow next to them.
   - File extensions (`.ts`, `.js`, `.md`, `.json`) indicate the type.

3. **Project Structure**
   - The top item is your project root (e.g., "FIN QUOTE").
   - Everything else is inside it.
   - Common folders:
     - `app/` — main application code
     - `components/` — reusable UI components
     - `lib/` — utility functions
     - `docs/` — documentation
     - `scripts/` — automation scripts

4. **Special Folders**
   - Folders starting with `.` (e.g., `.next`, `.git`) are often hidden and used by tools.
   - `node_modules/` — installed dependencies (usually large).

5. **Status Indicators**
   - Colored dots or icons show Git status (modified, new, etc.).

## How to Use It

- Click a folder to expand/collapse.
- Click a file to open it in the editor.
- Right-click for options (new file, delete, etc.).

The filetree helps you navigate your project and understand its organization.

utility functions? and how is a filetree different from a 'worktree'? and explain what these special folders are? and explain the git status icons.

## 1. Utility Functions

Utility functions are reusable helpers that perform common tasks.

- Example: calculating a percentage, formatting dates, validating email addresses
- Why: avoid repeating code; write once, use many times
- In your project: `lib/` contains utility functions used across the app

Example:
```typescript
// lib/utils.ts - A utility function
export function formatCurrency(amount: number) {
  return `$${amount.toFixed(2)}`
}

// Now you can use it anywhere:
formatCurrency(100) // Returns "$100.00"
```

## 2. Filetree vs Worktree

- Filetree: the folder/file view in your IDE. It shows the project structure.
- Worktree: a Git feature that lets you check out multiple branches in separate directories. Most projects use one worktree (the main project folder). You can ignore this for now.

## 3. Special Folders Explained

- `.next/` — Next.js build output (auto-generated)
- `.git/` — Git version control data (hidden)
- `.cursor/` — Cursor IDE settings
- `.github/` — GitHub Actions workflows
- `node_modules/` — Installed packages (don’t edit)
- `.env.local` — Environment variables (secrets, API keys)

## 4. Git Status Icons

These show file changes in Git:

- M (Modified) — file was changed
- A (Added) — new file, not yet committed
- ?? (Untracked) — new file, Git isn’t tracking it yet
- D (Deleted) — file was deleted
- Colored dots in the filetree — similar indicators (green = new/modified, brown = modified)

In your project:
- `app/actions/ask-question.ts` — Modified (M)
- `data/aapl-financials-quarterly.json` — Untracked (??)

These help you see what changed before committing.

"Worktree: a Git feature that lets you check out multiple branches in separate directories. " explain this. checkout? and why would you use multiple branches? remember i am a beginner dev.

## What is "Checkout"?

**Checkout** means switching to a different version of your code in Git.

Think of it like:
- Opening a different version of a document
- Switching between different saved game files
- Changing TV channels

When you checkout a branch, Git switches your files to that branch’s version.

## What is a Branch?

A branch is a separate timeline of changes.

Think of it like:
- The main story (main branch) — your working code
- A side story (feature branch) — where you try new things without breaking the main story

Example:
- `main` branch = your live webs
